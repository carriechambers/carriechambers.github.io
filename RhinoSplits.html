      <h1>Rhino Splits</h1> 
      <p>Rhino Splits is a fictitious start-up company that has hired me to research, design, test, redesign, and develop a mobile app that offers peer-to-peer payment services. This project summary will walk you through my process for the project.</p>

  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>"How might we provide an easy solution for people to exchange money instantly?"</p>
    <p>One of the first thoughts I had was "We have Venmo and Paypal and other options already… So is there really is a problem to solve?" In order to answer that question, I needed to connect to and understand the users. In order to narrow my interviews down to the right people, I came up with the following user persona to guide me through this process.</p>

  <h3>User Persona: Millennial Meg</h3>
  <p><img src="images/Rhino Splits/RS_persona_bio.png" alt="Millenial Meg persona"></p>
  
  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>How might we provide a solution for Meg's need to be accepted and appreciated in a social group? To find out, I surveyed and interviewed users like Meg.</p>
      
  <p>I found, not surprisingly, that security is the overwhelming first place concern for users. Users need to be confident they are exchanging money with real people, the right people, and have a clear trail to track transactions. So security should be our top priority, but it won’t necessary help us stick out next to other P2P payment services.</p>
      
  <p> So I dug further, and I found that simplicity is an opportunity for Rhino Splits to overtake the competition. Just think about the typical environment where our users will use the product: crowded/loud restaurants, bars, clubs - this process needs to be easy and simple in order for our users to use it successfully. The users have spoken, a wide portfolio of fancy features, while neat,  isn’t what they need. They just want to pay, and be paid.</p>

  <h3>Revised Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>With primary users defined and their feedback gathered, I was able to revise and finalize the Problem Statement to guide my next steps: "How might we become the most widely used P2P payment service that provides the easiest to use and most secure product?"</p>

  <h3>Journey Map</h3>
  <p>With this goal in mind, I needed to examine one of the most common journeys our users take with Rhino Splits so I could come up with the best solution.</p>
  <p>Meg is out for brunch with a few of her friends. For one reason or another, they decide it’s easier for one person to pay and everyone will pay them back later. Here are the steps Meg goes through on this journey:<br><br>

  <h3>Wireframes</h3>
  <p>During mid-fidelity user testing, I discovered that I had placed the selections to include yourself in the bill split calculation and the split method too far along in the process and caused users to get confused and feel like they had to start the process over. The users were excited about the receipt hot spots because it was one way to meet their need to avoiding the “who owes who?” conundrum.</p>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <p>After user testing with wireframes and implementing the necessary changes, I was able to produce a prototype to pass on to developers. The next step will be to vigorously test and tweak the app as much as needed before the official launch. As a final recommendation, no matter how successful the launch is, it will be very important to conduct ongoing usability testing to foster continuous improvement for our users and the success of Rhino Splits.<br><br> <img src="images/Rhino Splits/RS_prototype.png" alt="Wireframe"></p>
  
  <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I’m not going to love every product I work on</li>
        <ul>
          <li>But that's okay! It keeps me less biased and focused on the user's point of view<./li>
        </ul>
        <li>It’s hard being a one-person team</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Not only is there simply more work, innovation and accountability is limited. It's helpful to have a team to brainstorm with and keep in line when we forget to think like our user.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>It’s easy to stop asking for feedback</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is surprisingly easy to stop referring back to the user and, instead, rely on my own preferences and ideas.</li>
          </ul>
